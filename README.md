Project Proposal: 

 

Executive Summary:  

Our proposed project is a digital payment and financial inclusion platform that aims to provide secure and convenient financial services to people in Bangladesh. The platform will be modeled after successful digital payment platforms like Bkash and will leverage the latest technology to offer a seamless user experience. 

Background: 

 Despite having a rapidly growing economy, a significant portion of the population in Bangladesh remains unbanked and underbanked. However, with the rise of digital payment platforms like Bkash, there is an opportunity to provide financial services to this underserved population. Our proposed project aims to build on the success in digital banking and take this system to another level. 

Objectives:  

The objectives of our project are as follows: 

To provide a secure and user-friendly digital payment platform that can be accessed by anyone with a mobile phone. 

To promote financial inclusion by enabling people to open a digital wallet and access financial services like savings, loans, and insurance. 

To facilitate digital payments for e-commerce, utility bills, and other transactions, thereby reducing the need for cash transactions. 

To enable merchants to accept digital payments, thereby increasing financial inclusion and reducing the cost of transactions. 

Key Features:  

Our proposed digital payment platform will include the following key features: 

Digital wallet: Users can open a digital wallet and store money in it. They can then use the wallet to pay for goods and services, transfer money to others, cash out and make bill payments. 

Payment Gateway: 

 Our payment gateway will enable merchants to accept digital payments from their customers.
